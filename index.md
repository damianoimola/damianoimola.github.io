*Ciao!* :wave: 
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	Welcome to my blog, I'm Damiano Imola, and my academic journey has taken me through a Master's degree in <i><b>Artificial Intelligence and Robotics</b></i> at the University of Rome, La Sapienza; building my solid foundation in <i><b>Computer Engineering</b></i> at University of Rome, Tor Vergata.
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	My true north is Computer Vision, however, my curiosity spans wide: optimization, generative modeling, image and video processing, and robotics. 
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	The engine under the hood of my biggest interests is parallel computing. There's a deep satisfaction, in architecting a problem so that it can be solved not just by one core, but by hundreds or thousands working in concert. The <i>"scalable, brute-force efficiency"</i>.
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	I love tech gadgets, DIY, and deal with computers and embedded systems; actually my "embedded system" adventures are mostly limited to a trusty Raspberry Pi Zero W, but this is what I mean for <i>"embedded system"</i> :floppy_disk:.
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	Generally, food is always appreciated here; if I haven't mentioned it before, I am Italian, so please (I won't say anything more). I really like what I cook and my favorite dish is called "pasta risottata", with whatever human-eatable sauce :spaghetti:.
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	The last passion that I'm slowly building is travelling. Each time you come back from a trip, you are a different person in many areas: personally, emotionally, wisely (ok, you got it). The visited countries are: :us:, :uk:, :netherlands:, :fr:, :romania:, :es:, :brazil: and :it:.
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	I strongly think that AI is not here to threaten humans making us redundant, but to augment our abilities :brain:.
