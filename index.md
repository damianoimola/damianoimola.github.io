*Ciao!* :wave: 
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	Welcome to my blog, my name is Damiano Imola and I am pursuing a master's degree in <i>Artificial Intelligence and Robotics</i> at the Università degli Studi di Roma, La Sapienza. Formerly I studied <i>Software Engineering</i> at Università degli Studi di Roma, Tor Vergata.

	My heart belongs to Computer Vision, but I have other interests like optimization, generative modeling, and image and video processing. I love tech gadgets and deal with computers and embedded systems (actually I have only a Raspberry Pi Zero W, but this is what I mean for <i>"embedded system"</i>) :floppy_disk:.

	Generally, food is always appreciated here; if I still didn't mention that, I am Italian, so please (I won't say anything more). I really like what I cook and my favorite dish is Pasta Risottata, with whatever human-eatable sauce :spaghetti:.

	The last passion that I'm slowly building is travel. Each time you come back from a travel, you are a different person in many areas: personally, emotionally, wisely (ok, you got it). The visited countries are: :us:, :uk:, :es: and :it:.

	I strongly think that AI is not here to threaten humans making us redundant, but to augment our abilities :brain:.
